abstract: >
  Regular path queries (RPQs) are a fundamental part of recent graph query
  languages like SPARQL and PGQL. They allow the definition of recursive path
  structures through regular expressions in a declarative pattern matching
  environment. We study the use of the K2-tree graph compression technique to
  materialize RPQ results with low memory consumption for indexing. Compact
  index representations enable the efficient storage of multiple indexes for
  varying RPQs.
