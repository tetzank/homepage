  Regular Path Queries (RPQs) are at the core of many recent declarative graph
  pattern matching languages. They leverage the compactness and expressiveness
  of regular expressions for matching recursive path structures. Unfortunately,
  most prior works on RPQs only consider breadth-first search as traversal
  strategy, neglecting other possible graph traversals like depth-first search
  or a combination of both. Within this paper, we conduct an analysis of graph
  traversals for RPQs by introducing a generalized graph traversal framework
  subsuming breadth-first search and depth-first search as extreme cases and
  thus opening up a new design space for graph traversal algorithms. We outline
  the underlying principles as well as provide comprehensive experimental
  evaluation using implementations which yield beneficial results regarding
  evaluation time and peak memory consumption.
