  Ad hoc code generation is a state-of-the-art processing paradigm for database
  execution engines. It minimizes resource consumption by generating
  specialized code, tailored and streamlined for the single query at hand. In
  this work, we apply ad hoc code generation to regular path queries (RPQs), an
  advanced query type in declarative graph query languages. We investigate code
  generation from multiple angles. We propose COAT, an embedded domain specific
  language (EDSL) in C++ to improve accessibility of code generation by
  simplifying the interaction with compiler APIs. Furthermore, we analyze and
  compare two back ends for COAT providing the just-in-time (JIT) compilation
  functionality: LLVM, a compiler framework popularly used in databases for
  code generation, and AsmJit, a JIT assembler with very low compilation
  latency. We evaluate various compilation techniques for RPQs on different
  synthetic graph workloads.
