  A fundamental ingredient of declarative graph query languages are regular
  path queries (RPQs). They provide an expressive yet compact way to match
  long and complex paths in a data graph by utilizing regular expressions. In
  this paper, we systematically explore and analyze the design space for the
  data structures involved in automaton-based RPQ evaluation. We consider
  three fundamental data structures used during RPQ processing: adjacency
  lists for quick neighborhood exploration, visited data structure for cycle
  detection, and the representation of intermediate results. We conduct an
  extensive experimental evaluation on realistic graph data sets and
  systematically investigate various alternative data structure
  representations and implementation variants. We show that carefully crafted
  data structures which exploit the access pattern of RPQs lead to reduced
  peak memory consumption and evaluation time.
